# make-gcc
Bash script to build arbitrary versions of g++, boost and gdb.

Builds a specified version of the gcc compiler, boost library
and gdb debugger.

To use it after the installation, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH and
MANPATH variables must be set properly.

For each run a log is created in /tmp/make-gcc-2.sh-DTS.log where
DTS is the date-time stamp of the run. The log location can be
controlled by setting the LOGDIR environment variable.

Here is how its used to build gcc-6.4.0, boost-1.66.0 and gdb-8.1
in a local directory.

```bash
$ # build in ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/6.4.0-1.66.0-8.1
$ ./make-gcc.sh 6.4.0 1.66.0 8.1
```

If you want to explicitly specify the output, do this.

```bash
$ ./make-gcc.sh 6.4.0 1.66.0 8.1 -o /opt/gcc
```
