# make-gcc
[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jlinoff/make-gcc.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/jlinoff/make-gcc/releases)

Bash script to build arbitrary versions of g++, boost and gdb on linux.

Builds a specified version of the gcc compiler, boost library
and gdb debugger.

To use it after the installation, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH and
MANPATH variables must be set properly. It generates a tool
named gcc-enable to set them for you. It also generates a tool
named gcc-disable to disable them.

For each run a log of stdout and stderr is created in /tmp/make-gcc.sh-DTS.log
where DTS is the date-time stamp of the run. The log location can be
controlled by setting the LOGDIR environment variable.

### Example 1
Here is how its used to build gcc-6.4.0, boost-1.66.0 and gdb-8.1
in a local directory.

```bash
$ # build in ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/6.4.0-1.66.0-8.1
$ ./make-gcc.sh 6.4.0 1.66.0 8.1
.
.
$ source ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/6.4.0-1.66.0-8.1/gcc-enable
$ g++ --version$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 6.4.0

### Example 2
If you want to explicitly specify the output, do this.

```bash
$ ./make-gcc.sh 6.4.0 1.66.0 8.1 -o /opt/gcc
$ source /opt/gcc/bin/gcc-enable
$ g++ --version$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 6.4.0
