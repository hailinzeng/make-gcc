# make-gcc
[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jlinoff/make-gcc.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/jlinoff/make-gcc/releases)

Bash script to build arbitrary versions of g++ on linux.
Can optionally build boost and gdb as well.

Builds a specified version of the gcc compiler and, optionally, the
boost library and the gdb debugger on linux. It was written to consolidate
the functionality of the version specific scripts that I have written into
a single tool.

To use it after the installation, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH and
MANPATH variables must be set properly. It generates a tool
named gcc-enable to set them for you. It also generates a tool
named gcc-disable to disable them.

For each run a log of stdout and stderr is created in /tmp/make-gcc.sh-DTS.log
where DTS is the date-time stamp of the run. The log location can be
controlled by setting the LOGDIR environment variable.

### Example 1 - Build gcc-7.3.0
Here is how it is used to build gcc-7.3.0 in a local directory.

```bash
$ # build in ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/7.3.0
$ ./make-gcc.sh 7.3.0
.
.
$ source ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/7.3.0/gcc-enable
$ g++ --version$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 7.3.0
```

### Example 2 - Build gcc-6.4.0, boost-1.66.0 and gdb-8.1
Here is how it is used to build gcc-6.4.0, boost-1.66.0 and gdb-8.1
in a local directory.

```bash
$ # build in ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/6.4.0
$ ./make-gcc.sh 6.4.0 1.66.0 8.1
.
.
$ source ./linux-ubuntu-16.04.3-x86_64/6.4.0/gcc-enable
$ g++ --version$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 6.4.0

### Example 3 - Explicitly specify the output path
If you want to explicitly specify the output path, do this.

```bash
$ ./make-gcc.sh 6.4.0 1.66.0 8.1 -o /opt/gcc
$ source /opt/gcc/bin/gcc-enable
$ g++ --version$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 6.4.0

```

This is very useful when building the same compiler with different versions
of boost.

### Arguments

| Position | Argument      | Required | Meaning    |
| -------: | ------------- | :-------: | ---------- |
| 1        | GCC_VERSION   | yes       | The version of gcc to build. |
| 2        | BOOST_VERSION | no        | The version of boost to build. If not specified, boost is not built. |
| 3        | GDB_VERSION   | no        | The version of gdb to build. If not specified, gdb is not built. |

### Options

| Short Form | Long Form       | Description |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| -b VERSION | --boost-version VERSION | Specify the boost version to build. If not specified, boost is not built. |
| -c         | --clean.Â        | Clean up the target directory before building. |
| -f FLAVOR  | --flavor FLAVOR | The boost C++ standard to build to. The default is c++11. |
| -g VERSION | --gdb-version VERSION | Specify the gdb version to build. If not specified, gdb is not built. |
| -G OPTS    | --gcc-extra-conf-opts | Specify extra coniguration options for the compiler. Could be used for something like `-G "--with-python=python2.7"`|
| -h         | --help          | Help message. |
| -o DIR     | --out DIR       | Explicitly specify the output directory path. This overrides the prefix so|platform and version information are as lost |
| -p PREFIX  | --prefix PREFIX | Prefix of the build location. |
| -V         | --version.      | Print the program version and exit. |
